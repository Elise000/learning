# Setting Up Dynamic DNS
This note is about setting up a server locally to host for internet.
Mentioned here are general guidelines to get things work since it involves a
number of variables, such as router type, server host etc.

<br>
There are 3 stages of milestones you need to attain:

## 1st Milestone - Local Access
This involves setting up your router to port-forward or to have a virtual server
that route the incoming request to your local machine.

<br>
You'll need:

1. 2 computers (1 to view, 1 to host) with browser
2. Router admin access

<br>

Your goal is:
```
to ensure the viewer computer is able to view the host computer
```

### Steps
#### 1) Access your router
Access to your router using your admin access.


<br>

#### 2) Go to Private Server / Port Forwarding
Head to a section commonly known as 'port forwarding'.


#### 3) Setup your Private Server if it's available in your router
If your router has a private server, go for it. The setup is very
straight-forward.
