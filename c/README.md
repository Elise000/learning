# C
This section contains all my C learning and knowledge. It's primarily based on
Linux kernel coding standards, which I find sensible and great to adapt. The
standards manual can be found here:
	https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

Most codes will be improved over time based on new findings and learning.
