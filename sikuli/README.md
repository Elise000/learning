# Installation Steps
## Ubuntu
1) At minimum, you'll need to download sikulixsetup-X.Y.Z.jar to run.


2) Install the dependencies required to run sikuli. You can find an automated script inside the setup folder.


3) Run the sikulixsetup-X.Y.Z.jar with the installed JAVA.


4) Install accordingly. I use both Jython and Jruby in case.
